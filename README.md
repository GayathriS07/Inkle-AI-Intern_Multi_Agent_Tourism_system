# Inkle-AI-Intern_Multi_Agent_Tourism_system
A multi-agent tourism assistant built in Python. It reads natural language queries, detects the location, and fetches real-time weather and tourist spots using Nominatim, Open-Meteo, and Overpass APIs. The parent agent coordinates child agents to return only the information the user asks for.
